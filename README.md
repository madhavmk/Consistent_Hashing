# Distributed Hash Table
## Advanced Algorithms Project

### Requirements : 
1. Python 3.x
2. Python 2.7

To run the 

1. naive_tests.py : Naive implementation of the gistributed Hashing Algorithm
2. Consistent_Hashing_with_Virtual_Nodes.py : Run on python version 2. Consistent Hashing implementation with virtual nodes.
3. binary_search_tree/tests.py : An example of the Binary Search Tree implementation of the consistent hashing algorithm.

Performance Tests:

perf_measure_1.py : finds imbalance in data load when deleting consecutive nodes

perf_measure_2.py : finds efficency of adding new nodes to ring

perf_measure_3.py : to calculate the efficiency of adding extra virtual nodes

perf_measure_4.py : timed the find operation on the BST implementation

binary_search_tree/perf_measure : measure of adding nodes to the BST implementation
